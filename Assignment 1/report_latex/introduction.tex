In this assignment, we explore Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms, focusing on Policy Iteration and Value Iteration. We analyze their implementation and the impact of iteration count on utility estimates. The environment setup is described in Section 2, followed by Value Iteration (Section 3) and Policy Iteration (Section 4). Additionally, we define a convergence threshold $\epsilon \left( \frac{1 - \gamma}{\gamma} \right) \approx 0.001$, where $\epsilon = c \times R_{\max}$ by setting $c = 0.1$. This assignment was implemented in Python.
